# BigIntel_Internship_Greenhouse

This repository is dedicated to my internship at [Greenhouse Group](https://www.greenhousegroup.com/) in which I collaborated with the Artificial Intelligence team. I have researched and worked mostly on building, fine-tuning a topic classification model, discovering new relevant topics from a list of keywords, and researching ways to better understand the intent of a customer by their search phrases by using cutting-edge machine learning techniques.
